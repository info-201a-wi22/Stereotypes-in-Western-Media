Not only does this affect the youth and their growing perspectives on people in society, it also encourages adults to continue to stereotype. Due to the spread of misinformation through the media, there have been multiple incidences where these stereotypes have been used against many individuals. There are multiple examples of shows targeting the youth which have many stereotypes. One example of this is the show Jessie on Disney Channel. The show includes four kids who are adopted and live with a nanny. There is an Indian boy, an African American girl, a white boy, and a blonde girl. The Indian boy is shown as weak and nerdy with an Indian accent. The African American girl is shown as rebellious and sassy. The white boy is shown as athletic and the blonde girl is shown as dumb and boy obsessed. "),

Through watching media at a young age, many individuals may imprint an idea or an impression of a group of people due to the way they are shown in cinema. Implicit bias can also occur due to the imprinted idea of certain groups with a common identity. Unknowingly, seeing similar characters with similar characteristics in media over and over again can cause an audience to view those individuals and categorize all of them in that way."),

Some harms of this could be many individuals disagreeing with what is racist and what is not or what is okay to put and what is not because there is not really a right or wrong answer. Some unanticipated consequences could be that some individuals could feel that the diversity is too forced and the media has become to progressive too fast.

These groupings can be by race, class, gender, religion, country of origin, etc. The generalizations (whether negative or positive) are used to confine a group to others' standards and expectations. Our media and film contribute heavily to the perpetuation of stereotypes. By showcasing generalizations and presenting them as common concepts, they become mainstream ideas. We haven't completely gotten away from these stereotypes in movies but there are strides being made. These questions are to show that the stereotypes seen on tv and film can manifest in real life. This is because people will internalize what they've seen or don't see in their lives. People can be mistrusted and mistreated because of the stereotype associated with their group; racial profiling young black men is a contentious issue in the United States, while people perceived as Muslim, some of whom were in fact adherents to other faiths, were treated degradingly following the September 11th terrorist attacks. We are able to combat this by adding more inclusion and diversity. They have found that prejudices breaks down when people of various ethnic groups have increased contact with each other. A sociologist by the name of Nancy Wang Yuen said that \"Racism, in the form of job exclusion and racially stereotyped roles, has defined the Hollywood film industry since its birth in the early 1900s\" _(Reel Inequality: Hollywood Actors and Racism)_.

      tags$p("This data was collected by The Hollywood Reporter and Morning Consult, and published by The Morning Consult, in May 2019. While not explicitly stated, the purpose of the study as a whole seems to be to gauge how people of different religious, political, and employment backgrounds consume media and partake in various lifestyles. Considering the involvement of The Hollywood Reporter, the data collection effect was likely funded by that publication so that they could better share the study's findings as a part of their news offerings, and make more accurate conclusions about the state of the industries in question. Therefore, The Hollywood Report is likely to benefit from the data, as it improves their ability to make justifiable claims about various entertainment industries. Moreover, this dataset may give THR more ideas for news to publish, meaning that they will likely make money from the data. Unfortunately, it is hard to confirm whether the data is completely reliable and trustworthy, as the online survey format allows people to easily provide false information for the data collectors. More specifically, the source I linked states: \"Results from the full survey have a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.\" However, the sample size appears large enough that individual errors are not likely to change anyone's analysis of the data, nor is it likely to lead our group to reach false conclusions in the making of this project.

There are characters of women as well as individuals of different races which are constantly being stereotyped in the media. About 76% of people of color believe that there needs to be accurate representation of their race in western media. It is incredibly important to have accurate representation of race in the media. Individuals who watch movies and tv shows and see the stereotyped characters repeatedly will start to get this perception about that group of people, and start to create bias unknowingly. About 27% of Generation Z and 19% of Millennials feel that it is important to get rid of stereotypes. The issue and awareness of stereotypes in the media has become bigger in younger generations. Due to more awareness of racism and sexism and the root of their problems, individuals of younger generations are able to point out problems within society. About 16% of females and 17% of males feel as though it is important for film to have accurate representation of characters. In all, several individuals of all demographics feel that stereotypes in media are a major societal issue and can cause problems in all aspects of life. Many agree that it is important to have accurate information about groups of people in order to create real change in society. Additionally, removing any stigma around groups of individuals will allow for all audience members to have an authentic experience of the media they are watching."),

From creating the ideas to editing the film, there must be individuals with a range of identity characteristics in order to reduce bias and stereotypes. Additionally, this will allow for all audience members to relate and feel as if they are being properly represented by the characters and their story. One of the biggest issues regarding stereotypes in media is that the individuals who are creating the characters don't realize the characters they are making are stereotyped. There are deeper meanings regarding stereotyped characters that some people don't realize can cause a negative outlook on a demographic. For example, the black best friend, the Asian supermarket owner, the feisty Latina women, or the tech nerd Indian. It's important to get rid of these stereotypes and the only way to do so, or catch any bias within the making of the characters and a storyline is to have diversity within the western media. Additionally, it is important to understand that stereotypes may not be as apparent, or we may not realize the media has negative meaning towards a certain demographic. Audiences of all age groups and all demographics are affected by the media. Individuals who watch many movies with the same type of character with the same identity, will start to get the idea that all individuals are like this."),
